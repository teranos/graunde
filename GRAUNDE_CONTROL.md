# graunde

Ground Control for Claude Code. CLAUDE.md is advisory — graunde is the gate.

## Problem

Claude Code ignores CLAUDE.md instructions. You tell it "use `make test`", it runs `go test` without build tags, tests fail, and it starts "fixing" code that was never broken. You tell it "don't use `sed`", it uses `sed` with GNU syntax on macOS. The list never ends.

The only enforcement that works is at the tool level — a PreToolUse hook that intercepts commands before they execute. Not a suggestion. A gate.

## How it works

Runs as a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook on `Bash`. Reads JSON from stdin, extracts the command, checks it against controls compiled into the binary. Two actions:

- **arg** — add missing arguments after the matched command
- **omit** — strip unwanted flags from the command

Both silently amend and allow. Unmatched commands pass through (exit 0, no output). Every amendment includes an `additionalContext` message so Claude learns why the command was changed.

Controls are D source, compiled with `-betterC`. No runtime, no GC, no dependencies. The binary is the config.

## Language

D with `-betterC`. Compiled with LDC. Chosen for:
- No runtime, no GC — 8.7KB stripped binary, ~17ms latency
- CTFE — controls evaluated at compile time, baked into the binary
- `unittest` as a language keyword — tests live next to code
- C interop for stdio without overhead

## Controls

Controls are defined in `source/controls.d`. A control has:
- `name` — identifier slug
- `cmd` — substring to match against the command
- `arg` — arguments to insert after the matched command, OR
- `omit` — flag to strip from the command
- `msg` — context message sent to Claude via `additionalContext`

```d
static immutable allControls = [
    control("go-test-args", cmd("go test"), arg(`-tags "rustsqlite,qntxwasm" -short`),
        msg("Build tags and -short are required for go test in QNTX")),
    control("no-skip-hooks", cmd("git"), omit("--no-verify"),
        msg("Git hooks must not be bypassed, ever..")),
];
```

Commands are split on `|`, `;`, `&&` — each segment is checked independently.

## Hook protocol

**Input** (JSON on stdin):
```json
{
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "go test ./..."
  }
}
```

**Output** (amendment):
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "updatedInput": {
      "command": "go test -tags \"rustsqlite,qntxwasm\" -short ./..."
    },
    "additionalContext": "Build tags and -short are required for go test in QNTX"
  }
}
```

**Output** (no match): exit 0, no output.

## Hook registration

In `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "/path/to/graunde"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Countdown

### Ten — core engine ✓
Stdin JSON parsing, control matching, arg amendment, pipe splitting, unit tests. One control (`go-test-args`) end to end.

### Nine — betterC ✓
Drop the D runtime. No GC, no `std.json`, no exceptions. Hand-rolled JSON parsing. 8.7KB binary, ~17ms latency.

### Eight — omit + additionalContext ✓
Strip unwanted flags from commands. `omit("--no-verify")` removes the flag, lets the command through. `additionalContext` teaches Claude why commands were amended.

### Seven — make install
Makefile with `build`, `test`, `install`. `make install` builds release and copies to `~/.local/bin/`. Hook registration is manual.

### Six

### Five

### Four — commencing countdown, engines on

### Three

### Two — check ignition

### One — and may God's love

### Liftoff — be with you
